The title and problem statement is detailed as follows.

## Title: Statistical Analysis and Forecasting of Wind Energy (Intra-State)
Preparation files and guidelines:
1. Visit www.mnre.gov.in and understand about various renewable energy resources.
2. Note that our aim is to analyse wind energy for five study regions of the same state. If possible, we may
like to forecast wind energy for next week or even for next month.
3. Obtain 2000-2014 hourly wind speed data of five locations in the state of Rajasthan (visit MATHF432
google drive).
4. Look at various terms such as DHI, DNI, GHI, dew point, temperature, pressure, relative humididty,
wind speed, etc. Understand which terms/parameters are relevant to wind energy. In fact, we shall use
wind speed data for time-series analysis.
5. Perform several graphical plots or compute various descriptive statistics to understand the wind speed
data and their correlation to other parameters.
6. Now let us concentrate only on the wind speed data. Does the dataset (for a location) exhibit a normal
distribution? If not, identify the underlying probability distribution of the wind speed data for a location.
7. Let us now use a timeâ€“series analysis to the wind speed data. Do you see any trend or seasonality in the
data? Could you decompose this time series into various components? Is the data stationary?
8. Use AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, and SARIMA to the wind data for daily/weekly forecasting.
9. Discuss briefly how you have validated your results of time-series forecasting.

We worked as a group of 6 students, the team is as follows: Abdul Salim, V.Aravindan, Bhoomi Sawant, Dhruv Patel, Abhinava Arasada, Mohit Jangir.
